Vectopen is an open-source vector graphics editor built with **Godot Engine**. Designed for designers, developers, and creatives, Vectopen provides a lightweight, intuitive, and cross-platform solution (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and HTML5) for creating and editing vector graphics, such as illustrations, logos, and icons. It aims to be a competitive alternative to tools like **Adobe Illustrator** and **Affinity Designer**, focusing on accessibility, performance, and minimalist design.

- **Minimalist Interface**: Sleek, clean, and user-friendly for all skill levels.
- **Optimized Performance**: Runs efficiently on low-end hardware.
- **Advanced Tools**: Includes shader support and direct export to Godot Engineâ€™s **.tscn** format.
- **Accessibility**: Tailored workflows for beginners and professionals, including UI/UX, logos, and game assets.

## Main Objectives

- **UI**: Sleek, minimalist, and highly intuitive interface.
